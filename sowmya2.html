        <h1>Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November </h1>
        Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November 1828[4][5][6] in the town of Varanasi into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin
        family.[7] She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu.[8] Her father was Moropant Tambe[9] and her
        mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from Maharashtra.[10] Her mother died when she was
        four years old. Her father was the Commander of the war of Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao
        II of Bithoor district.[11] The Peshwa called her "Chhabili", which means "playful". She was educated at home
        and was taught to read and write, and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies
        included shooting, horsemanship, fencing[12][13] and mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tatya
        Tope.[14][15][dubious â€“ discuss] Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for
        women in India's society at this time.[16]

        Rani Lakshmibai was accustomed to riding on horseback accompanied by escorts between the palace and the temple,
        although sometimes she was carried in a palanquin.[17] Her horses included Sarangi, Pavan and Baadal; according
        to historians she rode Baadal when escaping from the fort in 1858

            Manikarnika was married to the middle-aged Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, in May 1842[4][18]
            and was afterwards called Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai) in honour of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi and according to
            the Maharashtrian tradition of women being given a new name after marriage. In September 1851, she gave
            birth to a boy, later named Damodar Rao, who died four months after birth. The Maharaja adopted a child
            called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the
            Maharaja died. The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from
            the Maharaja instructing that the child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be
            given to his widow for her lifetime.
